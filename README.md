This site is targeted to those who want to keep track of the books they read so like mainly students who are into the books. This site appeals to students with the easy to use functionality. I took account to people wanting an easier search function so it was added on to the book title being able to find a certain book better however it is not yet perfect. I considered mental model as it is just as it look nothing more and nothing less being able to keep track of the book that you want to keep track of. The webpage is super simple making it easy to use and get the job done. Although the thing that need to be improved on is more feature like having more book selection and a category selection. A affordance is that you have to manually do a good amount of the features. A constraint is that there isnâ€™t enough features that may be good making it so you have to type everything to use it. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15557392/how-do-i-display-images-from-google-drive-on-a-website https://medium.com/@svinkle/publish-and-share-your-own-website-for-free-with-github-2eff049a1cb5 https://www.htmldog.com/guides/ Finished tasks 1, 2, 3, 4abd, 5, 6
